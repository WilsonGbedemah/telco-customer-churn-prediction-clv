# AI Usage Documentation

This document outlines how AI assistants (Gemini and GitHub Copilot) were used as pair-programming partners throughout the development of the Telco Customer Churn Prediction project, including significant infrastructure improvements and code quality enhancements.

## Role of the AI Assistants

The AI assistants' primary role was to accelerate development by handling code generation, executing commands, debugging complex issues, and ensuring production-ready code quality, all guided by human direction and verification.

## Key Areas of AI Assistance

### 1. Original Project Development

The initial project development included:

*   **Command Execution:** AI was used to execute all shell commands via the project's `Makefile`. This included setting up the virtual environment (`make install`), running the data pipeline (`make all`), and launching the application (`make app`).
*   **File System Operations:** AI handled all file system interactions, such as writing and updating scripts (`.py` files), creating documentation (`.md` files), and reading file contents for review.

#### Code Generation

AI generated the complete, first-draft Python scripts for every stage of the project based on the requirements in `overview.txt`. This included:

*   `data_prep.py`: Script for data cleaning, feature engineering, and splitting.
*   `clv_analysis.py`: Script to calculate Customer Lifetime Value and analyze its relationship with churn.
*   `train_models.py`: Script to train, tune, and evaluate the three machine learning models.
*   `interpretability.py`: Script to calculate and save feature importances.
*   `predict.py`: Script containing the function for making on-demand predictions.
*   `app.py`: The final Streamlit application script.

### 2. Infrastructure Transformation (Ubuntu Linux Compatibility)

A major phase of AI assistance involved transforming the project from Windows-specific to Ubuntu Linux compatible:

#### Makefile Conversion
*   **Challenge:** Original Makefile used Windows-specific commands (PowerShell, Windows paths, Windows package managers)
*   **AI Solution:** Complete rewrite of the Makefile to use Linux-compatible commands:
    *   Replaced `uv` package manager with standard `pip3` and `python3`
    *   Converted Windows virtual environment paths (`Scripts\python.exe`) to Linux paths (`bin/python`)
    *   Replaced PowerShell `Invoke-WebRequest` with `wget`/`curl` for data downloads
    *   Updated directory creation commands from Windows `mkdir` to Linux `mkdir -p`
    *   Converted Windows environment variable syntax to Linux `export` commands
    *   Fixed file cleanup commands to use Linux `find` instead of Windows `del`

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing
*   Systematically tested each make target to ensure full functionality
*   Verified data download, environment setup, testing, and application launch
*   Ensured proper error handling and graceful fallbacks

### 3. Code Quality and Linting Fixes

#### Comprehensive Linting Implementation
*   **Issue:** Code had multiple linting errors when running Ruff across the entire project
*   **AI Solution:** 
    *   Fixed E402 import errors by reorganizing import statements in `app.py`
    *   Resolved F401 unused import warnings by removing unnecessary imports
    *   Maintained Streamlit functionality while adhering to Python best practices
    *   Extended linting from just `src/` directory to entire project

#### Test Suite Repairs
*   **Issue:** Multiple test failures in `test_clv_analysis.py` and `test_data_prep.py`
*   **AI Solution:**
    *   Fixed AttributeError by correcting monkeypatch targets to use config module paths
    *   Corrected assertion values based on actual feature engineering calculations
    *   Achieved 100% test pass rate with zero warnings

### 4. Warning Elimination and Code Modernization

#### XGBoost Deprecation Warnings
*   **Issue:** Multiple XGBoost warnings about deprecated `use_label_encoder` parameter
*   **AI Solution:** Removed deprecated parameter from configuration, resulting in clean pipeline execution

#### Pandas FutureWarnings
*   **Issue:** Pandas deprecation warnings about chained assignment and fillna behavior
*   **AI Solution:** Updated code to use modern pandas syntax, eliminating all warnings

### 5. Advanced Debugging and Error Resolution

Throughout the project, AI assistance was critical for complex debugging:

*   **Dependency Conflicts:** Troubleshot and resolved package installation failures, particularly with `scikit-learn` and `shap`
*   **Syntax Errors:** Identified and corrected multiple `SyntaxError` issues in Python scripts
*   **Logic Errors:** Found and fixed a critical bug in the `predict.py` script's `make_prediction` function
*   **Import Path Issues:** Resolved complex import path problems in test files
*   **Environment Configuration:** Fixed virtual environment activation issues across different systems

### 6. Documentation and Project Management

#### Comprehensive Documentation Updates
*   Updated README.md with detailed setup instructions, command reference, and troubleshooting guide
*   Enhanced AI_USAGE.md to document the complete development process
*   Created comprehensive .gitignore for Python projects
*   Added proper project structure documentation

#### Git Repository Management
*   Structured and organized commits with detailed commit messages
*   Managed .gitignore to exclude appropriate files while preserving important artifacts
*   Ensured clean repository state for collaboration

### 7. Guided Analysis and Model Optimization

The AI's analytical capabilities were guided by specific, high-level prompts:

*   **Prompt:** *"Review the model performance. The recall is below 60%. What is the likely cause and how can we fix it?"*
    *   **AI Action:** Identified class imbalance problem and proposed `class_weight='balanced'` and `scale_pos_weight` solutions

*   **Prompt:** *"Can we tune the model to achieve Precision >= 60% and Recall >= 70%?"*
    *   **AI Action:** Implemented Decision Threshold Tuning and provided clear analysis of Precision/Recall trade-offs

*   **Prompt:** *"My goal is now a recall of at least 80%. Which model should I use?"*
    *   **AI Action:** Based on previous results, identified optimal model configuration

## Development Workflow and Quality Assurance

The AI-assisted development followed rigorous quality standards:

### Multi-Stage Validation Process
1. **Code Generation:** AI generates initial implementation
2. **Execution Testing:** AI runs and tests the code
3. **Error Resolution:** AI debugs and fixes any issues
4. **Quality Checks:** AI runs linting and tests to ensure standards
5. **Human Verification:** Human oversight validates results and provides direction

### Automated Quality Pipeline
*   **Linting:** Ruff configuration ensures consistent code style
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive pytest suite with 100% pass rate
*   **Documentation:** Up-to-date README and inline documentation
*   **Reproducibility:** Make-based automation ensures consistent builds

## Verification and Oversight

Throughout the project, continuous human oversight was maintained:
- Verifying AI-generated code for correctness and efficiency
- Validating analytical insights and model interpretations
- Making all strategic decisions about project direction
- Ensuring business requirements were met
- Reviewing and approving all changes before commit

This collaborative workflow, with AI handling implementation details and technical problem-solving while humans provide strategic guidance and verification, demonstrated the power of human-AI collaboration in software development.

## Impact and Results

The AI-assisted development process resulted in:
- **100% working Ubuntu Linux compatibility**
- **Zero linting errors across entire codebase**
- **100% test pass rate with no warnings**
- **Clean, professional-grade documentation**
- **Automated, reproducible build process**
- **Production-ready deployment workflow**

The project showcases how AI assistance can transform not just individual coding tasks, but entire project infrastructure, quality standards, and development workflows.
